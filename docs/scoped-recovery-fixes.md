# Scoped recovery fixes

Changes against PR #21 at `95e4c5542c96c13ad18e1fa1ac9301f1a7e04e88`.

## Model replacement after container restart

The scoped slot manager now distinguishes a live trainer invocation from a live
model placement. It permits replacement when the owning boot changed or the
control plane has already reported model loss and removed the model's demand.
An unplaced model with outstanding demand still owns its slot: another client
cannot displace a healthy or initializing model. Replacement retires the old
model, and retries of its creation cannot resurrect it.

The restarted trainer can accept the new model without cancelling its invocation
or increasing the trainer limit. Existing terminal-invocation recovery remains
supported.

## Checkpoint API wiring

`ModalCheckpointStorage` provides the existing metadata, listing, and deletion
operations for both shared and scoped deployments. The scoped API binds these
callbacks to its configured checkpoint volume. The existing shared API keeps its
callbacks and lock, delegating to the same implementation.

This enables the public Tinker
`create_training_client_from_state_with_optimizer()` method inside a scope. The
scoped control-plane subclass remains unchanged; these fixes do not change the
base control plane's model-creation callback semantics.

## Validation

- Full CPU suite: **306 passed, 2 skipped**.
- New regression cases cover a boot change before and after the old client's
  loss response; reuse of the existing trainer; retirement of the old client;
  and rejection of competing clients while the current model is healthy or
  initializing.
- Existing checkpoint read/list/delete and scope-lifecycle tests pass.

### Live result — 2026-09-16

This result was recorded with the original restart test.

**Both requested recovery paths succeeded.** Of 21 live checks, 20 passed and
one numerical diagnostic exceeded its tolerance. The script deliberately exits
nonzero when any check fails; this is not an all-green numerical validation.

The test verified:

- A real ContainerStop restarted the same invocation with a different boot ID.
- The old client's normal forward request returned HTTP 410 `model_lost`.
- `create_training_client_from_state_with_optimizer()` created the second client
  in that scope. Its stored model specification has `restore_optimizer: true`.
- The second client reused the same invocation and new boot, with exactly one
  running trainer. No invocation cancellation or extra trainer was needed.
- Two resumed forward/backward and optimizer steps succeeded. Their mean losses
  were `0.3280329` and `0.0371729`; the first update changed the model's outputs,
  and a final forward returned finite log probabilities.
- The old client remained lost after replacement.
- SDK checkpoint metadata, listing, and deletion all worked.
- The app reached STOPPED with zero containers and zero tasks. An independent
  volume lookup verified checkpoint deletion; its empty parent was removed.

The diagnostic compared forward log probabilities before failure with those
immediately after restoration. Maximum absolute difference was `0.0047957003`
over 13 tokens, exceeding the existing `0.003` tolerance. Its cause is unresolved;
no tolerance was loosened to make the run pass. This test establishes functional
recovery and continuation, not bitwise or tightly bounded numerical equivalence
across trainer processes. Transient HTTP 500 responses during future retrieval
were retried by the SDK, and the scenario reached completion.

The [Modal run](https://modal.com/apps/modal-labs/connor-dev-2/ap-gIKuOfNPbED4miFTNdGDnG)
used only a new test app. Reports under `scripts/results/scoped-e2e/`:

- `restart-fix.json` and `.log`: checks, metrics, identities, and runtime output.
- `restart-fix-model-specs.json`: the replacement's checkpoint/optimizer settings.
- `restart-fix-cleanup.json`: independent app and checkpoint cleanup verification.
- `restart-fix-pytest.log`: full CPU suite result.
- `restart-fix-harness.py` and `restart-fix-runtime.patch`: reproduction snapshots.

## Remaining landing considerations

These changes address the two requested recovery defects. The earlier E2E run
also reproduced incomplete model downloads being treated as valid caches because
`config.json` exists; that asset-cache recovery issue remains worth fixing before
landing. The SDK's misleading connection error for an occupied slot remains an
error-reporting issue. The numerical continuation discrepancy requires a
repeatability control before attributing it to optimizer restoration.
