# Spindle design

Spindle presents the Tinker API while separating control-plane orchestration,
GPU execution, and sampling. Here, we describe the high-level design and interfaces
between these components. 

## System overview

A request moves through three layers: 

1. The stateless control plane owns the Tinker-facing API, session lifecycle,
   model placement, and sampling orchestration.
2. A training engine owns one or more model states as well as the actual distributed training backend (Megatron) that holds per-rank GPU workers. A frontend server in each engine turns ordered API calls into commands for the GPU workers, similar to the "broadcast" orchestration of RL libraries. 
3. The sampling plane loads published weights from the trainer via a shared Modal volume (the stitch "bulletin")and serves `sample` requests independent from the training engine. 

Both the training and sampling parts of the system are independently autoscalable: the control plane will provision new training engines for newly registered training clients, and the sampling layer will autoscale replicas based on incoming load through the Flash proxy gateway. 

## Control plane

The control plane is a stateless, autoscaling Modal web server. Its replicas are responsible for: 

- creating and expiring client sessions
- handling model creation, assigning models to engine containers, scaling the set of engines based on model demand, and routing training operations to each engine. 
- recording and resolving Tinker API futures 
- handling sampling (`asample` submission and futures) 

The control plane stores sessions, models, engine assignments, and sampling
state in Modal Dicts so every replica shares the same durable state.

## Training engines

Client sessions are handled by the control plane. Training engines receive only
model-scoped operations corresponding to Tinker API calls, including model
creation, forward and backward passes, optimizer steps, checkpoints, sampler
publication, and model unload.

Each accepted operation is assigned an ordered model sequence ID and a future.
The engine buffers later requests while the current command runs, allowing the
next command's inputs to accumulate before the accelerator is available. The
engine scheduler then selects the next ready command. Compatible
`forward_backward` operations can be grouped and their variable-length
sequences packed under the backend's token budget.

The engine exposes the command protocol in
[`engine/api.py`](../src/spindle/engine/api.py). Its scheduler and future handling
live in [`engine/server.py`](../src/spindle/engine/server.py).

### Execution lanes

To maximize concurrency through our system, we separate "GPU" operations from "non-GPU" operations, 
such that disk writing of checkpoints can be issued asynchronously and does not block the GPU. GPU-requiring commands are serialized, which preserves ordering of training commands and avoids concurrent mutation of weights/other states. 

Disk- and network-heavy persistence runs outside the GPU lane. Full checkpoints
and sampler publication have independent persistence lanes, so a long durable
state write cannot delay publishing weights for the next rollout. Each operation
is split into:

1. `capture_checkpoint`, which captures model state from the GPU onto immutable CPU buffers
2. `persist_checkpoint`, which writes that state to persistent storage *independent* of the GPU lane. 

Persistence can therefore overlap a later forward/backward or optimizer command
without reading partially updated model state.

## Weight publication

Sampler weights are persisted to Modal volumes shared with the sampling plane. With this setup, 
the training engine containers and entire sampling plane (and individual sampling replicas) need not be RDMA connected to each other, as p2p weight transfer is never used anywhere in the system. 

To minimize transfer latency, publication format depends on the parameterization:

- **LoRA:** each publication contains the full adapter weights. The adapter is
  written to the shared Stitch bulletin Volume and can be loaded independently
  by a sampler replica.
- **Full fine-tuning (FFT):** publications after the base version contain sparse
  weight deltas. Replicas discover versions through Stitch and walk the parent
  chain of deltas, applying updates in place until they reach the requested
  version.

Publications are immutable. A version becomes visible to samplers only after
its persistence phase completes.

## Sampling

An `asample` request creates one Modal Function call. That function owns the
sample attempt synchronously: it selects a compatible sampling replica, sends
the generation request, reroutes retryable failures, and returns the completed
Tinker sample response. The control plane stores the Modal Function call ID and
uses it as the durable future for polling and retries.

The sampling topology differs by parameterization:

- **LoRA (target topology):** one autoscaling Modal server hosts the base
  model. Adapters are loaded lazily from the bulletin Volume and retained in an
  LRU cache, allowing many adapters to share one sampling fleet. LoRA training
  is available today, but the Modal sample dispatcher is currently connected only
  to FFT definitions; the shared LoRA sampler still needs to be connected.
- **FFT:** each trained model has its own autoscaling Modal server. Stitch
  tracks exact and latest weight versions, while replicas update their local
  weights from the shared delta chain.

This separation lets training engines scale according to active models while
sampling scales according to rollout traffic. We best-effort sticky-route groups (GRPO) to the same container to maximize KV cache reuse. 

## Relevant implementation

  sessions, places models on engines, routes operations, and submits sampling
  requests

  control-plane state in Modal Dicts
- [`providers/modal/trainer_reconciler.py`](../src/spindle/providers/modal/trainer_reconciler.py):
  starts and stops training engines to match model demand
- [`engine/server.py`](../src/spindle/engine/server.py): orders model operations,
  batches compatible training requests, and runs persistence alongside later
  GPU work
- [`engine/spmd.py`](../src/spindle/engine/spmd.py): broadcasts backend commands to
  every rank and collects results

  and resolves versioned FFT weight updates (FFT sampler publication path)
- [`providers/modal/fft_pool.py`](../src/spindle/providers/modal/fft_pool.py):
  creates, finds, wakes, and stops each FFT model's sampling service using Modal flash proxy

## Adding a new model deployment

A Python deployment dataclass specifies the base model, training mode, context length, GPUs, parallelism, and inference settings. Shared deployments are defined only through these files.

1. Create a Python `Config` subclass under `src/spindle/configs/`, optionally inheriting from a packaged config.
2. Add its path to the list in [`scripts/deploy_models.sh`](../scripts/deploy_models.sh).
3. Run the script to apply the complete list to the shared frontend.

No central model catalog registration is needed. The generic builders in [`deployment_apps.py`](../src/spindle/providers/modal/deployment_apps.py) construct trainer functions and inference apps from the saved config. See [Python deployment configs](deployment-configs.md) for the configuration schema and app structure.

Set each configuration's trainer limit with `trainer.max_instances` and its inference limits with `inference.min_replicas` and `inference.max_replicas`. Trainer limits are read from the config; `SPINDLE_TRAINER_MAX_CONTAINERS` is no longer used.

## Adding a new backend

Each backend implements the synchronous per-rank interface in
[`backends/contract.py`](../src/spindle/backends/contract.py). `Engine`
handles asynchronous scheduling and calls the backend in rank lockstep.

Create a backend module that provides:

- a `Backend` implementation for model acceptance, forward/backward,
  optimizer steps, checkpoints, sampler publication, unload, and shutdown;
- `build_executor()`, which initializes distributed communication, constructs
  the backend, and returns its `DistributedExecutor`.

Use [`backends/megatron_lora.py`](../src/spindle/backends/megatron_lora.py) and
[`backends/megatron_fft.py`](../src/spindle/backends/megatron_fft.py) as the LoRA
and FFT references. A model definition passes its `module:build_executor` path
to `run_engine_with_backend`:

```
run_engine_with_backend(
    ...,
    "spindle.backends.megatron_fft:build_executor",
    ...
)
```

**Distributed Executor**: All ranks participate in commands through
[`engine/spmd.py`](../src/spindle/engine/spmd.py). Rank zero exposes the backend
HTTP bridge while the other ranks follow its broadcasts through `run_follower_loop`.
The `Engine` schedules operations and passes `Command` values to its
executor. `HttpBackendClient` in
[`engine/backend_http.py`](../src/spindle/engine/backend_http.py) implements that
interface across the local training subprocess boundary.

To maximize GPU utilization, we separate "GPU ops" (ie. forward_backward, optim_step) from "non-GPU ops" (ie. CPU -> disk checkpoint writing). For this reason, checkpoint and sampler publication operations are split into a GPU and non-GPU component:

1. `capture_*` writes out an immutable snapshot to CPU (in general can be any intermediate destination).
2. `persist_*` writes that snapshot on to persistent storage. 

The executor names these phases `capture_snapshot` and `persist_snapshot`.
The per-rank backend implements `persist_checkpoint` for checkpoints and
`publish_sampler_snapshot` for sampler weights. The latter persists the snapshot
and makes it available to samplers; checkpoint persistence does not imply sampler
publication.

`capture_*` operations hence are "GPU ops," and persistence/publication operations are "non-GPU ops" that can be run asynchronously from the GPU lane.

**IMPORTANT!!** The Engine handles the asynchronous scheduling of the GPU and persistence lanes. However, it is on the backend writer to ensure that their persistence/publication methods and GPU methods do not race with each other (ie. dont have conflicting access to the same state). We recommend against using locks for this purpose and have our LoRA and FFT backends written as references of how to implement lock-free backends. In our implementation, the main pattern is that `capture_*` creates detached CPU state that the persistence/publication method exclusively owns.
