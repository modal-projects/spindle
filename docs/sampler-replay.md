# Sampler replay

The Miles LoRA backend can train using the expert routes and token sampling
supports captured by SGLang. Capture is opt-in per sampling request:

- `return_routed_experts=True` captures the selected MoE expert IDs. Training
  reuses those selections while computing routing weights from its own logits.
- `return_sampling_mask=True` captures the allowed token IDs after top-k,
  top-p, and min-p filtering, together with log probabilities normalized over
  that support. Training normalizes over the same support and temperature.

Ordinary Tinker sampling discards additional response fields. Use
`spindle.sample_with_replay()` to receive them, then pass its replay tensors through
`Datum.loss_fn_inputs`. The Megatron full-training backend currently rejects
these fields; this integration is for the Miles LoRA backend.

## Server configuration

Sampling-mask capture needs no additional server flag. For router capture,
use a MoE model and set `ROLLOUT_RETURN_ROUTED_EXPERTS = True` in its rollout
pool definition. This adds SGLang's `--enable-return-routed-experts` flag.
Also append `--use-rollout-routing-replay` to the trainer's
`backend_config["miles"]["extra_args"]` before deployment.

Router capture increases the rollout server's memory use, and captured supports
can make responses large when top-p retains much of the vocabulary. Neither
capture is requested by default.

## Sample and train

This example assumes `training` is an existing Miles LoRA training client.
It uses a constant advantage to demonstrate the handoff; replace that with
advantages computed from your task's rewards.

```python
import spindle
from tinker import types

sampler = training.save_weights_and_get_sampling_client(name="replay-step")
tokenizer = training.get_tokenizer()
prompt_tokens = tokenizer.encode("The capital of France is", add_special_tokens=True)
prompt = types.ModelInput.from_ints(prompt_tokens)
sequence = spindle.sample_with_replay(
    sampler,
    prompt,
    sampling_params=types.SamplingParams(max_tokens=32, temperature=0.8, top_p=0.9),
    return_sampling_mask=True,
).result().sequences[0]

if not sequence.tokens:
    raise RuntimeError("No generated tokens to train on")
tokens = prompt_tokens + sequence.tokens
replay_inputs = sequence.replay.training_inputs(len(sequence.tokens))
datum = types.Datum(
    model_input=types.ModelInput.from_ints(tokens[:-1]),
    loss_fn_inputs={
        "target_tokens": tokens[1:],
        "advantages": [0.0] * (len(prompt_tokens) - 1) + [1.0] * len(sequence.tokens),
        **replay_inputs,
    },
)
forward = training.forward_backward(
    [datum],
    loss_fn="ppo",
    loss_fn_config=sequence.replay.loss_fn_config(),
)
optimizer = training.optim_step(types.AdamParams(learning_rate=1e-5))
print(forward.result().metrics)
print(optimizer.result().metrics)
```

For MoE router replay, additionally request `return_routed_experts=True` and
supply the model's **total transformer layer count** and routed experts per token:

```python
replay_inputs = sequence.replay.training_inputs(
    len(sequence.tokens),
    num_layers=model_config.num_hidden_layers,
    experts_per_token=model_config.num_experts_per_tok,
)
```

SGLang returns an unshaped base64 int32 routing buffer, so these dimensions must
match the deployed model. Every datum in a router-replayed request must provide
routes. The scheduler separates these requests from ordinary requests.

## Alignment and probability semantics

`training_inputs()` assumes one sampled continuation and an input of
`(prompt_tokens + sequence.tokens)[:-1]`. Expert routes cover those input
positions; sampling supports cover the generated targets. The helper inserts
empty, unrestricted support rows for prompt targets. Set prompt advantages or
cross-entropy weights to zero.

The helper supplies `logprobs` from the **masked sampling distribution**.
Spread its result after any other loss inputs so ordinary model log probabilities
do not overwrite them. `sequence.logprobs` retains the existing API meaning.
Always pass `replay.loss_fn_config()` to preserve the sampling temperature.

The mask is frozen from rollout: training does not recompute top-p from its
updated logits. Replay does not guarantee bitwise parity between SGLang and
Megatron kernels. For multi-turn trajectories or truncated sequences, callers
must realign replay tensors to their actual training inputs; the convenience
helper does not stitch turns.
